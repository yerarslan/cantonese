                Cantonese is a language that uses tones to convey meaning. That means learners need to pay attention to the pitch (i.e. high and low) of each syllable in order to understand what is being said. This is arguably the hardest area for self-learners, especially if oneâ€™s native language does not use a similar mechanism. CanTONEse was designed to solve this problem. In this app, Cantonese tones are visualised and colour-coded, illustrated with recordings, including words, phrases, and full conversations, by actual speakers. There is a step-by-step guide for beginners, and there are tools and games for more advanced learners who may need help on certain aspects of tones. This is an ultimate self-learning tool for learners from different levels who want to master this important and significant aspect of the Cantonese sound system.
